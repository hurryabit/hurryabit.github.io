This post provides the slides for my talk _Linear Time Variance Inference for PEP&nbsp;695_ I gave at the [Typing&nbsp;Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/typing-summit/) at [PyCon&nbsp;2025](https://us.pycon.org/2025/). There also is a [PDF version](/assets/files/pep695-variance-inference.pdf).
