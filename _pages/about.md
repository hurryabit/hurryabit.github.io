I'm Martin. I'm a software engineer with a passion for safe programming languages with a strong static type system, such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). I'm experienced in designing and implementing programming languages myself. I currently work at [Google](https://about.google/), building the next type checker for [Python](https://www.python.org/). In addition, I regularly teach the [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/) course.

Previosuly, I was part of the team building the smart contract language [Daml](https://www.digitalasset.com/developers/) at [Digital Asset](https://www.digitalasset.com/), leading the team for 2 years. Besides Haskell and Rust we also used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/). Before that, I worked in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) and did a PhD in computational logic.

I also like bikes.
