I'm Martin. I'm a software engineer with a passion for safe programming languages with a strong static type system, such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org). I'm experienced in designing and implementing programming languages myself. I was part of the team building the smart contract language [Daml](https://www.haskell.org) at [Digital Asset](https://www.digitalasset.com), leading the team for 2 years. Besides Haskell and Rust we also used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Scala](https://scala-lang.org). Before that, I worked in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com) and did a PhD in computational logic. I also like bikes.
